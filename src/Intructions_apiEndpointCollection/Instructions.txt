Getting Started with Project Setup

To initiate the project, follow these steps:

Step 1: Install Dependencies

Open your project terminal and run one of the following commands depending on your preferred package manager:
- bun i
- npm i
- yarn 

This command installs all necessary dependencies required for the project.

Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Update the .env file by replacing REDIS_URL and MONGO_URL with your respective database URLs:


REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
MONGO_URL=your_mongo_url


Step 3: Start Development Server

In the project terminal, type:


bun start:dev


This command starts the development server.

Step 4: Test API Endpoints

Open Postman and update the base URL to:


http://localhost:3000


Begin testing API endpoints.



- Ensure you have the necessary package manager installed (Bun, npm, or Yarn).
- Verify your Redis and MongoDB URLs are correctly updated in the .env file.
- Use Postman to test API endpoints thoroughly.

By following these steps, you'll successfully set up and start testing your project.
